## Description

_A GitHub Lookup application that allows users to view public repositories and descriptions by username_

## Setup/Installation Requirements

_Clone the repo and open it up. Make sure to do the following so you can use the necessary npm/gulp/bower/SASS packages and utilities:
 *The package.JSON should have everything, so just use "npm install" and "bower install" to download everything in git. The gulpfile.js for this project should let you just use "gulp serve" to open up the web app once everything is downloaded. Be sure to use a .env file with exports.apiKey exporting your GitHub API key set equal to the "apiKey" variable used in lookup.js
